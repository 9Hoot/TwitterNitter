# TwitterNitter
Javascript bookmarklet script to redirect from twitter.com URLs to nitter ones, and vice versa.

To use it, copy the code within `bookmarklet.js` and paste it into the URL field of a bookmark.

The default Twitter -> Nitter instance is `https://nitter.net`.
To use a different instance, modify `preferredInstance`.

A list of Nitter instances can be found at https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances.

This is a personal project, so do not expect updates unless the code breaks or otherwise does not function as it should.

Nonetheless, feedback is appreciated.
