# TwitterNitter
TwitterNitter is a Javascript bookmarklet that redirects from `twitter.com` and `x.com` URLs to nitter ones, as well as vice versa.

To use it, **copy the code within** `bookmarklet.js` **and paste it into the URL field** of a new bookmark.

The default Twitter to Nitter instance is `https://nitter.poast.org`.<br>
To use a different instance, edit `var preferredInstance = "https://nitter.poast.org";` by right-click and `Edit`ing the bookmark.

A list of Nitter instances can be found at https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances.

This is a personal project, so do not expect updates unless something happens and I remember this repo exists.

Nevertheless, feedback is appreciated.
